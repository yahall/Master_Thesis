# Title: Media Coverage of the Pandemic: Evidence from Swiss Newspapers
This repository contains all the current codes I am implementing in terms of my Master's Thesis at the University of Zurich, in which I apply several NLP approaches such as topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and multilingual sentiment analyses (both in an unsupervised manner). Please note that these are not the final codes yet, as I am currently still working on them. The final codes will be made available right after the submission deadline in the end of October 2021.
